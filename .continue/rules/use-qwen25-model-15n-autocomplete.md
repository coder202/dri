description: Ensure consistent use of AutoComplete mode `qwen2.5` with version
  `1.5b` to enhance productivity and code quality within the identified contexts
  using glob patterns in file names.

Set the autocomplete mode to `qwen2.5` with version `1.5b`. Ensure this is used for TypeScript files and JavaScript test cases. Apply only when relevant glob patterns are detected in file names (e.g., *.ts, *test*.js).
